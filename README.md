# sales_rep_visit_tracker_feature

Your task is to build a Visits Tracker feature for a Route-to-Market (RTM) Sales Force
Automation app. Design and structure your solution as though this feature is part of a
larger, scalable application.
The app should allow a sales rep to:

* Add a new visit by filling out a form
* View a list of their customer visits
* Track activities completed during the visit
* View basic statistics related to their visits (e.g., how many completed)
* Search or filter visits
